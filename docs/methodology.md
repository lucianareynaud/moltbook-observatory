# Methodology Notes

## Epistemic posture
Public interaction traces are not ground truth. A conservative integrity observatory must not commit the category error of treating observable regularities as proof of authorship class. We define **integrity risk** as the likelihood that observed patterns are produced by coordination, automation misuse, or manipulation; scores are therefore triage signals intended for prioritization, not adjudication.

## Feature families and confounders
Temporal burstiness may reflect time zones, scheduled content, or high-activity accounts; lexical redundancy may reflect narrow topical focus; synchronization may emerge from genuine external events. For each feature, cohort-normalized residuals are preferable to naive global thresholds. Reports should separate descriptive statistics (what happened) from anomaly detection (what deviated) and interpretive hypotheses (possible explanations, explicitly labeled as hypotheses).

## Evaluation discipline
If supervised modeling is introduced, it must include clear label provenance, a holdout protocol, calibration analysis, and error analysis that treats false positives as first-class failure modes.
